# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), and this project adheres
to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.9.2] - 2022-01-24

### Fixed

- üêõ Scaled registers to use division instead of multiplication ‚Äì prevents rounding errors.
- üìñ Update README.md to match reality better
- üßΩ Update deps
- üõ† Try to re-enable GH pages

## [0.9.1] - 2022-01-13

### Fixed

- üêõ The `_time` fault registers don't denote a BCD-encoded timestamp, but seems to be a counter of #cycles the fault
  lasted.
- Sometimes a time slot timestamp is returned as `60` minutes. Guard by taking the modulo-60 instead.

## [0.9.0] - 2022-01-13

### Added

- üí™ Create `RegisterCache` and `RegisterGetter` to contain the custom register data structures in one place. Also
  started a `Plant` model to be a container for all devices in a given system.
- üõ† Add JSON processing for the RegisterCache ‚Äì mostly to help with testing but also expecting debugging other plants
  to benefit from it.
- üë∑ Add some more test cases with actual register data.
- üö® Added some recovery logic to the framer ‚Äì try to scan ahead for other messages instead of truncating the entire
  buffer when there's unexpected data incoming. Hopefully this helps when the communication stream seems to get out of
  sync a bit.
- üôÖ Add an `ErrorResponse` PDU so we can try and cope better when the inverter throws error responses.
- üßΩ Added `absolufy-imports` and `autoflake` to pre-commit checks.

### Changed

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Ensure we check charge and discharge limits: current hardware cannot support >50% (i.e. >2.6kW) rates.
- ‚úÖ Make sure we query the 180+ block of input registers too, since it contains (amongst others) battery energy
  counters.
- ü§î Split out querying the battery/BMS registers since this will vary depending on how many batteries the user has. The
  slave address of the request determines which battery unit is targeted.
    - Also start modeling the Battery as separate from the Inverter.
- üîé Collapse the register cache to a single dict since we can use the `HoldingRegister`/`InputRegister` identity to
  discern between the types. It makes the data structures a lot simpler.
- üõ† Improve the CLI ‚Äì it is already a useful tool to dump registers for debugging right now.
- üò≥ Changed to target slave id 0x11 by default instead of 0x32. 0x32 shadows 0x11 but seems to be the first battery,
  with subsequent batteries living at the following slave addresses.
    - ‚òùÔ∏è reverted that change because it seems to affect the cloud metrics quite badly when you query frequently.
- ü§´ Squelch flake8 warnings about missing constructor and magic method docstrings.
- ü©π Update README to show usage properly.
- üßπ Update python deps.

## [0.8.0] - 2022-01-09

### Added

- A large number of convenience methods in the client to alter the state of the inverter:
    - `enable_charge_target(target_soc: int)` & `disable_charge_target()`
    - `enable_charge()` & `disable_charge()`
    - `enable_discharge()` and `enable_discharge()`
    - `set_battery_discharge_mode_max_power()` and `set_battery_discharge_mode_demand()`
    - `set_charge_slot_n((start_time: datetime.time, end_time: datetime.time))` and `reset_charge_slot_n()`
      for slots 1 & 2. Also matching `set_discharge_slot_n((start_time, end_time))` and `reset_discharge_slot_n()`.
    - `set_mode_dynamic()` to maximise storage of generation and discharge during demand. This mirrors "mode 1"
      operation in the portal.
    - `set_mode_storage(slot_1, [slot_2], [export])` which keeps the battery charge topped-up and discharges during
      specified periods. This mirrors modes 2-4 in the portal.
    - `set_datetime(datetime)` to set the inverter date & time.
- Ensure we _always_ close the network socket after every request. Sometimes the inverter turns orange/grey in the
  portal after executing queries via this library, and this seems to mitigate against it ‚Äì possible the inverter TCP
  stack isn't closing half-closed sockets aggressively enough?

### Changed

- **Potentially breaking:** Once again, pretty wholesale renaming of registers to more official designations, and
  standardising naming somewhat. Part of the motivation for adding more convenience functions is so clients never have
  to deal with register names directly, so this should hopefully make future renaming easier.

## [0.7.0] - 2022-01-05

### Added

- Another register whitelist and check in the `WriteHoldingRegisterRequest` PDU as another layer of checks to not
  inadvertently write to unsafe registers. Add a test to ensure the allow list stays in sync with the register
  definitions from `model.register_banks.HoldingRegister`.
- A bunch of convenience methods to write data to the inverter without needing any knowledge of registers.
  See `client.GivEnergyClient` which has a number of `set_*` methods.

### Changed

- Split out the end-user client functionality from the Modbus client - they were getting too entangled unnecessarily.
  Updated example code in README for reference.
- Renamed `target_soc` to `battery_target_soc` instead.

## [0.6.2] - 2022-01-04

### Fixed

- Will this fix `mindsers/changelog-reader-action@v2`?

## [0.6.1] - 2022-01-04

### Fixed

- Fix stupid pypi classifier strictness

## [0.6.0] - 2022-01-04

### Changed

- **[BREAKING CHANGE]** registers have been widely renamed for consistency and clarity. The joys of a pre-release API.
- Checked all the registers and their values to make sense. Added units for most that are self-evident. The
  `Inverter` object is shaping up nicely as a user-friendly representation of the inverter dataset ‚Äì TODO is likely
  splitting out a `Battery` representation too, to account for systems with multiple battery units (and those without
  batteries at all!). The same might make sense for the PV aspect as well.

### Fixed

- Avoid loading a whole batch of input registers that seem completely unused and save a network call.
- Match prod release workflow to preview to use py3.9
- Update PyPI classifiers to specify Alpha quality :)
